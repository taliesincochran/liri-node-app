Then there might be baby internet trolls... Scary.
Wouldn't the world be great if internet trolls were rounded up and put in a cell to enjoy each others company...
I wish cat's didn't feel the need to spray stuff.
I do know that was only two wishes.
I don't like ads.
If I had three wishes, I'd wish that none of my wishes could have unforeseen consequences then wish for more wishes.
I wish I had more time to play video games and binge watch netflix.
This is boring.
