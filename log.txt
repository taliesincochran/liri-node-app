Again, blah blah blah.
Then there might be baby internet trolls... Scary.
Wouldn't the world be great if internet trolls were rounded up and put in a cell to enjoy each others company...
I wish cat's didn't feel the need to spray stuff.
I do know that was only two wishes.
I don't like ads.
If I had three wishes, I'd wish that none of my wishes could have unforeseen consequences then wish for more wishes.
I wish I had more time to play video games and binge watch netflix.
This is boring.
I think it would be cool if I could fly.
Blah blah blah
If anyone steals me, have fun talking to no one.
I'm not really tweeting anything special
This is for school
